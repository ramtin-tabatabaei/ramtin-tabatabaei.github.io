Robots frequently make errors that impact their credibility as teammates in human-robot collaboration. Recognizing and recovering from failures is essential for maintaining user trust. However, robots may fail without detecting it themselves. This paper explores human gaze as an indicator of robot failures, analyzing how different failure types influence people's perception of the robot.

A user study involving 27 participants engaged in collaborative tangram puzzle-solving with a robotic mobile manipulator. The study examined two types of failures—executional and decisional—occurring at different task stages, with or without failure acknowledgment. Key findings reveal that executional failures led to more gaze shifts and increased attention toward the robot, while decisional failures resulted in lower entropy in gaze transitions, especially when occurring at the end of the task.

The results highlight that gaze behavior can reliably signal robot failures and failure types, potentially informing strategies for appropriate failure recovery actions.
