I am a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Computing and Information Systems, University of Melbourne, supervised by [A/Prof. Wafa Johal](https://wafa.johal.org/) and Prof. Vassilis Kostakos. I am part of the Human-Computer Interaction Group and the [Human-Robot Interaction Lab](https://chri-lab.github.io/).

During my Master’s degree, my research focused on identifying gaze patterns that help robots determine the optimal person to look at during multi-party interactions. I analysed various social cues—such as distance, speech, and other behavioural signals—to improve robotic attention mechanisms in group settings.

## My Research

My research goes beyond assuming robots or AI systems are perfect. I study how mistakes and failures that occur during interaction or collaboration between humans and robots affect user perceptions—particularly **how much trust users lose after such failures**.  

There are several important characteristics of failures that influence users differently, such as:
- The **type** and **timing** of the failure  
- Whether the failure occurs as part of a **sequence of failures**  
- The **number** and **severity** of the failures  

It is crucial for robots to recover effectively from their failures. My research aims to design and evaluate interaction strategies that help robots maintain user trust and improve recovery after failure.

### Research 1 — Detecting Robot Failures via Human Gaze

For robots, detecting and predicting failures as early as possible is vital to prevent potential damage or negative user experiences.  
To achieve this, I studied **user non-verbal behaviours**, especially **gaze patterns**, to identify cues that indicate when a failure is about to occur.  

We found that:
- **User gaze behaviour** can signal the onset of a robot failure.  
- Gaze patterns are related to the **type of failure** the robot makes.  
- A **Random Forest classifier** showed strong potential for detecting failures within a few seconds after they occur.  

This study highlights how human gaze can serve as a real-time indicator for robot performance monitoring.

### Research 2 — Trust Dynamics Across Multiple Robot Failures

Robot failures can occur multiple times during interaction, and their effects on user trust can accumulate over time.  
This project investigates:
- How **sequences of failures** influence user trust  
- How much **robot awareness** are needed to recover trust after repeated failures
